This is a bit tidied version of the source code for ``Norsk Forvaltningslov for Reinsdrift''.

Practically of the code is written by Morten Hustveit (aka. Circle of Fadeout). Source derived 
from other sources are commented as such.

Two of the textures (the JFIF-JPEG ones) are copied from Quake 3. As far as I know, these are 
freely redistributable. The reason for us using these, is that we didn't have time to make 
our own replacements.
