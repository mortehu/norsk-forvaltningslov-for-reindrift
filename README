This is a bit tidied version of the source code for "Norsk Forvaltningslov for
Reindrift".

Core written by Morten Hustveit in 2002. Source derived from other sources are
commented as such.

Two of the textures (the JFIF-JPEG ones) are copied from Quake 3. As far as I
know, these are freely redistributable. The reason for us using these, is that
we didn't have time to make our own replacements.
